# Language-Analyzer
 
This is a set of tools to analyze and understand natural language at the word level, the sentence level and hopefully, the idea level. 

Eventually, the goal would be to get as close as possible to a complete set of rules for the english language. Hopefully, higher level structures in language like ideas, concepts and the like could be captured.

Some questions: how far can one go in the analysis of language without needing information about how humans use it? For example, conjugating a verb is independent of who is using it or how, but a joke's potential to make people laugh depends heavily on who the people are. Is there a kind of fuzzy boundary on the structural hierarchy of language before which it is more or less formalizable, and after which it becomes more or less contextual? The more abstract the ideas you're trying to talk about are, the more context you need to understand them. The tradeoff happens because in going more abstract, you need to chop off lots of detail so you're sentence doesn't become too long.

Ideas are just networks of smaller ideas joined together by conceptual links, logic, intuition, similarity and things like that. What's the simplest possible idea? What are the leaves of the network? The "axioms" might be the words themselves. What are the edges? Explaining something to someone might be like traversing the network of ideas, stopping by at smaller nodes to explain a sub-topic, and flowing across the network using logical connectors, verbs, and other stuff to get somewhere.
